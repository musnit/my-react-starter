split dependencies into dev and not dev

fix heroku build to run on deploy not on dyno start

!! heroku port fix

change weird session reducer pattern to be immutable and to expose a function that
creates the reducer, types, actions, etc, rather than exporting the reducer itself.
Then this function should have parameters to allow for changes through functional composition and such,
rather than through mutating the exported object itself.

add some rest and crud ducks+ui+autoform stuff.
