# App

Info:
This is a front end app built with React and Redux. It uses some patterns from
https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example and
https://github.com/este/este so it's recommended
to become somewhat familiar with these libraries.

Note:
Dev server runs off index.html and devServer.js
Heroku server runs off prodIndex.html and prodServer.js

Transforms are enabled for files inside `src` (except `index.js`).
